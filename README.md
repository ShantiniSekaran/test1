##How to deploy files into git and why SSH is used over HTTPs?   
###SSH means "secured shell".SSH is prefered over HTTPs to reduce security threats for remote server login as SSH uses key passphrase and not password for authentification as with HTPPs. HTTPs requires repetitive authentification using password to perform any action which is tedious as compared SSH.Therefore, SSH which uses key passphrase is considered safer and convenient compared to HTTPs.
