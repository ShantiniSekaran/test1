## How to deploy files into git ?    
### 1. We create a new file under our project/folder and name the file.    
### 2. On the terminal, we push the file to git using the following command:
```sh
git add . 
git commit -m "added filename " 
git push
```


## Why SSH is used over HTTPs ?   
### SSH means "secured shell".   
### SSH is prefered over HTTPs to reduce security threats for remote server login as SSH uses key passphrase and not password for authentification as with HTPPs. 
### HTTPs requires repetitive authentification using password to perform any action which is tedious as compared SSH.Therefore, SSH which uses key passphrase is considered safer and convenient compared to HTTPs.
